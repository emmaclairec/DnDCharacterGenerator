# The ~~Worst~~ BEST D&D Character Generator
### TerribleHack (2+2)/22/22 Submission

## Why did we make this?
I (Emma) really struggled making my character sheet the first time I attempted to play D&D. Because I have the first session of my second attempt on the Sunday of this hackathon weekend, I thought I would use the opportunity to force myself to read through the Player's Handbook.

***It has been said that no character is truely unplayable with 5e... so we made some changes.***

## Deviations from the Handbook

Due to time constraints and trying to make things intentionally terrible, these are some of the changes we made:
 - Dropping the highest rolls for generating ability scores rather than dropping the lowest.
 - Hard coding values including speed and alignment.
 - Starting everyone with negative gold.
 - A bunch of other stuff, probably.


## How to Use

Everything is available for download in the repository. If you are having any issues getting your python IDE set up - there's a lot of sample outputs included in the Outputs folder.

### Troubleshooting

We've had some issues seeing the pdf annotations, depending on what you're using to view the vile. Downloading the file and opening in Chrome usually works.
Some sample images have been included-just in case.
